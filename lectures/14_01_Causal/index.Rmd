## Pro tip

Learn to say no politely. The primary source of motivation in academics (and in many other places) is guilt. To prevent total insanity you need to:

* Say no to most things and focus
* Do it in a way that doesn't offend people
* Do it in a way that doesn't make you feel guilty

This is an art and requires years to master. [Some never do](http://www.bcaffo.com/).

## About causal analysis

__Goal__: To find out what happens to one variable when you make another variable change. 

* Usually randomized studies are required to identify causation
* There are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomized studies, but they are complicated and sensitive to assumptions
* Causal relationships are usually identified as average effects, but may not apply to every individual
* Causal models are usually the "gold standard" for data analysis

## About mechanistic analysis

__Goal__: Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects.

* Incredibly hard to infer, except in simple situations
* Usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations (physical/engineering science)
* Generally the random component of the data is measurement error
* If the equations are known but the parameters are not, they may be inferred with data analysis

## An outsider's perspective on causal inference

1. With randomized trials -> straightforwardish (we'll see why in a minute)
2. With observational data -> much, much harder
  * Main problem is confounding
  * The key idea are the assumptions
3. It is all about missing data
  * Missing confounders
  * Missing counterfactual observations
4. Causal inference is not easily described in standard statistical/probabilistic notation.

## Representing causal relatinships

* Rubin model:
  * $Y(0), Y(1)$ or $Y_x(u)$
  * Outcome Y, had the individual, u, received treatment 0,1 or X.
* Pearl model:
  * $Pr(Y = y | do(X=x))$
  * Distribution when setting X=x
* Graphical models

## What do those arrows mean? 

<img class=center src=../../assets/img/shoesize.png height=150>


* Intuitively - an arrow $S \rightarrow L$ means X "influences" Y
* Bayes Networks/Graphical models - represent conditional probabilities e.g. $Pr(S,L| A) = Pr(S| A)Pr(L|A)$

## Representing causal relatinships

$\mathrm P(G,S,R)=\mathrm P(G|S,R)\mathrm P(S|R)\mathrm P(R)$
