## Course take-homes

* Focus on the science first - make sure your models make sense
* There is rarely _one true path_ 
  * Real problems involve choices
  * Keep it simple as possible!
  * Justify everything
* When building new methods don't reinvent the wheel
* We talked about a range of methods but there is a ton more to learn
* Be a go getter

## Qual checklist

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10z0Y69EfYRohTfw7qwNPqVSEH6hbewm4_q3Gsaxq93w/edit)

1. Did you answer the question?
  * Did you think about the bigger picture?
  * Did you think hard about the specific context?
  * Did you adapt your approach to the specific problem?
2. Stat methods:
  * Did you perform a thorough exploratory analysis?
  * Did you write down the exact model you are fitting?
  * Did you interpret the coefficients correctly?
  * Did you provide measures of uncertainty and interpret what they mean?
  * Did you describe potential problems with your approach?

## Checklist continued

3. Write-up
  * Were you concise and precise?
  * Do your figures convey important information/have good captions?
  * Did you include references for methods you used?
  * Did you explain why: why those variables, why that model, why the results you got make sense/don’t, why you have confidence/don’t in the response, why....
4. Reproducibility
  * Did you include library() commands for all libraries you used at the top of your script?
  * Did you include comments about what each chunk of the code is doing in case I need to do minor tweaks?
  * Does the output of the code make it easy for me to check the numbers/figures?
  * Once you finished writing the code, did you save it, log out, and run it one more time? Even better, run it on a different computer.

## Remember Teddy

"It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat."
