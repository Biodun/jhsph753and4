## Pro tip

Academia is a weird place. The main criteria you are evaluated on is research. Everything we learn about in this class is focused on that. But in reality you spend a huge amount of time doing the following:

* Meetings
* Giving talks
* Advising students
* Teaching
* Reviewing (grants, papers, etc.)
* Interacting with collaobrators 

These skills are often secondary in graduate programs but become hugely important very quickly when you become a faculty member. Learning how to do them well early is a fast way to make the transition to faculty dramatically easier.

## KNN neighbors 


Basic idea

$$\hat{Y}(x) = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{x_i \in N_k(x)} y_i$$

$$\hat{f}(x) = {\rm Ave}(y_i | x_i \in N_k(x))$$

## An example of least parametric to most


<center> KNN -> Logistic Regression -> LDA -> Fully Bayesian model </center>

* KNN $\hat{Pr}(x == k) = {\rm Ave}(y_i ==k | x_i \in N_k(x))$
* Logistic regression fit $logit(Pr(x = k) | X = x) = \beta x$
* Linear discriminant analysis $argmax_k \phi_k(x) = x^T\Sigma^{-1} \mu_k - \frac{1}{2} \Sigma^{-1} + \log(\pi_k)$
* Fully Bayesian model
