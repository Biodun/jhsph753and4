## Why do data science?

"It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat."

## The key challenge in data science

"Ask yourselves, what problem have you solved, ever, that was worth solving, where you knew knew all of the given information in advance? Where you didn’t have a surplus of information and have to filter it out, or you didn’t have insufficient information and have to go find some?"

## What are methods?

The term "methods" is somewhat open to interpretation - this is
one potential way to break journals down to give some insight


* __Theory__: Annals of Statistics, JRSSB, JASA TM
* __Data Analysis__: JRSSC, Nature, NEJM, JAMA, Genome Biology
* __Methods__: Biometrics, AOAS, Biostatistics, Neuroimage, Genome Biology, Bioinformatics

Many PhD theses "resemble" methods papers, and contain material
similar to that discussed in 573. 

---

## Goals of this course

Upon completion of this course students will be able to:

1. Obtain, clean, transform and process raw data into usable formats
2. Formulate quantitative models to address scientific questions
3. Organize and perform a complete data analysis, from exploration, to analysis, to synthesis, to communication. 
4. Understand and apply a range of statistical methods for inference and prediction.
5. __Develop ideas for new statistical methods, tools, and analyses__

Students will also be encouraged to independently read and apply statistical methods from texts and the scientific literature that are not covered in the course. They will also be encouraged to think of improvements or variations on existing methods to address specific scientific questions.

## Grading policy 

_I believe the purpose of the Ph.D. is to train you to be able to think for yourself and initiate and complete your own projects. I am super excited to talk to you about ideas, work out solutions with you, and help you to figure out statistical methods and/or data analysis. I don't think that graduate school grades are important for this purpose. This means that I don't care very much about graduate student grades._

The only purpose for grades in my mind is to communicate whether you are on the path to passing the qual. Here are the grades I will give for that purpose.

* A = Do this well and you will pass
* B = Do this well and you will likely pass
* C = Do this well and you will have trouble
* D = Rarely given, means we need to have a talk

---

## Evaluation and feedback

* 35%  =  Data analysis (peer graded/instructor summarized)
* 20%  =  Bi-weekly problems (graded by TA)
* 10%  =  Data analysis review (completion)
* 25%  =  Final Project (graded by instructor)


* You will get receive
  * Grades on the methods problems
  * Feedback from your peers
  * Brief (< 1 paragraph + grade) feedback from me within a week of submitting your analyses.
  
_If you would like further feedback on your assignments please schedule time to meet with me. I will try to leave Fridays available from 10am-3pm in 20 minute slots available. You may book up to 3 slots at a time: http://jtleek.youcanbook.me/_

## Prediction

<img class=center src=../../assets/img/08_PredictionAndMachineLearning/centraldogma.png height=450>


---

* Define the question
* Define the ideal data set
* Determine what data you can access
* Obtain the data
* Clean the data
* Exploratory data analysis
* Statistical prediction/modeling
* Interpret results
* Challenge results
* Synthesize/write up results

---

## Defining a question

<img class=center src=../../assets/img/stat-projects.jpg height=400 />

1. Statistical methods development
2. [Danger zone!!!](http://www.drewconway.com/zia/?p=2378)
3. Proper data analysis 


---

## An example

__Start with a general question__

Can I automatically detect emails that are SPAM that are not?

__Make it concrete__

Can I use quantitative characteristics of the emails to classify them as SPAM/HAM?

---

## Define the ideal data set

* The data set may depend on your goal
  * Descriptive - a whole population
  * Exploratory - a random sample with many variables measured
  * Inferential - the right population, randomly sampled
  * Predictive - a training and test data set from the same population
  * Causal - data from a randomized study
  * Mechanistic - data about all components of the system

## Our example

<img class=center src=../../assets/img/datacenter.png height='400' />
[http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/](http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/)


---

## Determine what data you can access

* Sometimes you can find data free on the web
* Other times you may need to buy the data
* Be sure to respect the terms of use
* If the data don't exist, you may need to generate it yourself


---

## Back to our example

<img class=center src=../../assets/img/security.png height='400' />


---

## A possible solution


<img class=center src=../../assets/img/uci.png height='400' />

[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase)


---

## Obtain the data

* Try to obtain the raw data
* Be sure to reference the source
* Polite emails go a long way
* If you will load the data from an internet source, record the url and time accessed

---

## Our data set

<img class=center src=../../assets/img/spamR.png height='400' />

[http://search.r-project.org/library/kernlab/html/spam.html](http://search.r-project.org/library/kernlab/html/spam.html)



---

## Clean the data

* Raw data often needs to be processed
* If it is pre-processed, make sure you understand how
* Understand the source of the data (census, sample, convenience sample, etc.)
* May need reformating, subsampling - record these steps
* __Determine if the data are good enough__ - if not, quit or change data

---

## Our cleaned data set

```{r}
# If it isn't installed, install the kernlab package with install.packages()
library(kernlab)
data(spam)
str(spam[, 1:5])
```

[http://search.r-project.org/library/kernlab/html/spam.html](http://search.r-project.org/library/kernlab/html/spam.html)


--- 

## Subsampling our data set
We need to generate a test and training set (prediction)
```{r,message=FALSE}
# If it isn't installed, install the kernlab package
library(kernlab)
data(spam)
# Perform the subsampling
set.seed(3435)
trainIndicator = rbinom(4601,size=1,prob=0.5)
table(trainIndicator)
trainSpam = spam[trainIndicator==1,]
testSpam = spam[trainIndicator==0,]
```

---

## Exploratory data analysis

* Look at summaries of the data
* Check for missing data
* Create exploratory plots
* Perform exploratory analyses (e.g. clustering)

---

## Names
```{r}
names(trainSpam)
```


---

## Head
```{r}
head(trainSpam)
```

---

## Summaries
```{r}
table(trainSpam$type)
```

---

## Plots
```{r,fig.height=5,fig.width=5}
plot(trainSpam$capitalAve ~ trainSpam$type)
```

---

## Plots 
```{r, fig.height=5,fig.width=5}
plot(log10(trainSpam$capitalAve + 1) ~ trainSpam$type)
```

---

## Relationships between predictors
```{r, fig.height=5,fig.width=5}
plot(log10(trainSpam[,1:4]+1))
```

---

## Clustering
```{r,echo=FALSE}
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0))

```

```{r, fig.height=6,fig.width=7}
hCluster = hclust(dist(t(trainSpam[,1:57])))
plot(hCluster)
```

---
## New clustering
```{r, fig.height=6,fig.width=7}
hClusterUpdated = hclust(dist(t(log10(trainSpam[,1:55]+1))))
plot(hClusterUpdated)
```

---
## Statistical prediction/modeling

* Should be informed by the results of your exploratory analysis
* Exact methods depend on the question of interest
* Transformations/processing should be accounted for when necessary
* Measures of uncertainty should be reported

---
## Statistical prediction/modeling
```{r,warning=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
trainSpam$numType = as.numeric(trainSpam$type)-1
costFunction = function(x,y) sum(x!=(y > 0.5)) 
cvError = rep(NA,55)
library(boot)
for(i in 1:55){
  lmFormula = reformulate(names(trainSpam)[i], response = "numType")
  glmFit = glm(lmFormula,family="binomial",data=trainSpam)
  cvError[i] = cv.glm(trainSpam,glmFit,costFunction,2)$delta[2]
}

## Which predictor has minimum cross-validated error?
names(trainSpam)[which.min(cvError)]
```

---

## Get a measure of uncertainty
```{r,warning=FALSE}
## Use the best model from the group
predictionModel = glm(numType ~ charDollar,family="binomial",data=trainSpam)

## Get predictions on the test set
predictionTest = predict(predictionModel,testSpam)
predictedSpam = rep("nonspam",dim(testSpam)[1])

## Classify as `spam' for those with prob > 0.5
predictedSpam[predictionModel$fitted > 0.5] = "spam"
```

---

## Get a measure of uncertainty

```{r}
## Classification table
table(predictedSpam,testSpam$type)

## Error rate
(61+458)/(1346+458 + 61 + 449)
```

---

## Interpret results

* Use the appropriate language
  * describes 
  * correlates with/associated with
  * leads to/causes
  * predicts
* Give an explanation
* Interpret coefficients
* Interpret measures of uncertainty

---

## Our example

* The fraction of charcters that are dollar signs can be used to predict if an email is Spam
* Anything with more than 6.6% dollar signs is classified as Spam
* More dollar signs always means more Spam under our prediction
* Our test set error rate was 22.4% 

---

## Challenge results

* Challenge all steps:
  * Question
  * Data source
  * Processing 
  * Analysis 
  * Conclusions
* Challenge measures of uncertainty
* Challenge choices of terms to include in models
* Think of potential alternative analyses 

---

## Synthesize/write-up results

* Lead with the question
* Summarize the analyses into the story 
* Don't include every analysis, include it
  * If it is needed for the story
  * If it is needed to address a challenge
* Order analyses according to the story, rather than chronologically
* Include "pretty" figures that contribute to the story 

---

## In our example

* Lead with the question
  * Can I use quantitative characteristics of the emails to classify them as SPAM/HAM?
* Describe the approach
  * Collected data from UCI -> created training/test sets
  * Explored relationships
  * Choose logistic model on training set by cross validation
  * Applied to test, 78% test set accuracy
* Interpret results
  * Number of dollar signs seems reasonable, e.g. "Make money with Viagra \\$ \\$ \\$ \\$!"
* Challenge results
  * 78% isn't that great
  * I could use more variables
  * Why logistic regression?
