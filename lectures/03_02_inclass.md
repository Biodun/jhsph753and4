Google Scholar Activity
=======================

One question that has come up several times when looking at how faculty spend their time is how much do faculty:

1. Work on their own statistical projects?
2. Collaborate with scientists?

We also might be interested in knowing the distribution of collaborators for faculty members. Are they in the school? Are they at the university? What departments do they come from? 

Our plan is to collect data from Google Scholar to answer these questions.
